### Getting Started
Sam and Dylan hitting the back end starting strong with migrations, databases, and seeding. Kat and Addie will hit the front, with Kat leading the charge of structuring our apps files, navigation bar, and components, with Addie coming behind inserting boilerplates, page constructions etc. Once the basic structure of our application has been built out; the team will reconvene on to focus on axios calls, and CRUDS as priority #1 taken on mostly by Front ends pit crew. Once CRUD has hit a certain completion percentage, and models/ routes have taken full effect. Authenticating users will be the next priority to this Formula 1, Gran Turismo inspired application.
